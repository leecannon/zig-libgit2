# Plans

- [ ] Implement entire API from commit `3f02b5b95e90d6be25aedf3f861e173182e815d7`
- [ ] Update with all API changes up to latest master
- [ ] Build against each version from latest to oldest and mark added APIs using `@hasDecl`
- [ ] Add documentation to *every* function and type including docs for return value
- [ ] Remove unnecessary duplicated named, e.g. `Credential.CredentialUsername` should be `Credential.Username`
- [ ] Add functionality to build.zig to include as either static or dynamic
